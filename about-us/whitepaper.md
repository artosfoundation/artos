Artos chose the Binance Smart Chain Main Network as a means to leverage solidity-based smart contracts with far greater speed and efficiency than other networks.

BSC itself has become one of the most widely used blockchains for decentralized finance (DeFi), BSC uses a token protocol developed by the Binance Team called BEP-20 which is known for its block speed of 5 seconds which is much faster than blocks on other networks on average. speed 1 to 2 minutes.
