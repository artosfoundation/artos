# ⚠ Risk Disclaimer

Please consider the following risk factors (many of which are cryptographic token specific and inherent) before using any part of our Wallet/website/platform and before purchasing and/or trading Artos cryptographic tokens or any other cryptographic tokens that we (or third parties - third party service providers accessed through our platform) may offer through our Wallet/website/platform from time to time (“token”). Token value and your ability to access and transfer tokens could be materially and adversely affected if any of these risk factors materialize. As a result, when you buy tokens, you expose yourself to considerable risk and potential financial loss.

Please also note that this Risk Statement is not exhaustive. You should do further research (and seek professional advice) to carefully determine whether buying and/or trading tokens is suitable for your particular financial situation and risk tolerance.

{% hint style="info" %}
SUBJECT TO ANY CONDITIONS ACTUALLY SET FORTH IN OUR EULA, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OCCURRED TO YOU AS A result of YOUR ACCESS TO OUR PLATFORM OR FROM THE PURCHASE, TRANSFER OR USE OF YOUR TOKEN.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**THE TOKEN IS A HIGH RISK ASSET AND YOU SHOULD NOT USE YOUR UNLOSSIVE FUNDS FOR TOKEN PURCHASES**</mark>
{% endhint %}

#### PRICE VOLATILITY

Token prices can experience dramatic fluctuations and high volatility due to rapid changes in supply and demand resulting from events such as but not limited to: (a) good or bad publicity, (b) changes in the financial technology industry, (c) technological advances, ( d) market trends, (e) general economic and/or political conditions, (f) adoption rates, (g) levels of institutional support, (h) regulatory measures, (i) levels of government support, (l) market dynamics , (m) trading activity, (n) hacking, and (o) events affecting major service providers, including exchanges.

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:yellow;">**DUE TO PRICE volatility, YOUR TOKEN MAY LOSE ALL VALUE AND BECOME VALUE. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES YOU MADE AS A RESULT OF THE INTERNAL PRICE VOLATILITY OF THE TOKEN.**</mark>
{% endhint %}

CRYPTOGRAPHIC WALLET

The tokens are stored in a cryptographic wallet ("Wallet"). A private key (for example, a passphrase) is usually required to access, control and/or dispose of the tokens stored in your Wallet. Losing access to the private keys associated with your Wallet may result in the permanent loss of your ability to access and dispose of your tokens.

You are solely responsible for implementing all reasonable and appropriate measures to secure access to your private keys and Wallet.

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:yellow;">**WE DO NOT HOLD A COPY OF YOUR PERSONAL KEY. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE DUE TO YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS YOUR WALLET AND/OR PERSONAL KEYS**</mark>
