# ⚠ Risk Disclaimer

Please consider the following risk factors (many of which are cryptographic token specific and inherent) before using any part of our Wallet/website/platform and before purchasing and/or trading Artos cryptographic tokens or any other cryptographic tokens that we (or third parties - third party service providers accessed through our platform) may offer through our Wallet/website/platform from time to time (“token”). Token value and your ability to access and transfer tokens could be materially and adversely affected if any of these risk factors materialize. As a result, when you buy tokens, you expose yourself to considerable risk and potential financial loss.

Please also note that this Risk Statement is not exhaustive. You should do further research (and seek professional advice) to carefully determine whether buying and/or trading tokens is suitable for your particular financial situation and risk tolerance.

{% hint style="info" %}
SUBJECT TO ANY CONDITIONS ACTUALLY SET FORTH IN OUR EULA, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OCCURRED TO YOU AS A result of YOUR ACCESS TO OUR PLATFORM OR FROM THE PURCHASE, TRANSFER OR USE OF YOUR TOKEN.
{% endhint %}

<mark style="color:yellow;">**THE TOKEN IS A HIGH RISK ASSET AND YOU SHOULD NOT USE YOUR UNLOSSIVE FUNDS FOR TOKEN PURCHASES**</mark>
{% endhint %}

#### PRICE VOLATILITY

Token prices can experience dramatic fluctuations and high volatility due to rapid changes in supply and demand resulting from events such as but not limited to: (a) good or bad publicity, (b) changes in the financial technology industry, (c) technological advances, ( d) market trends, (e) general economic and/or political conditions, (f) adoption rates, (g) levels of institutional support, (h) regulatory measures, (i) levels of government support, (l) market dynamics , (m) trading activity, (n) hacking, and (o) events affecting major service providers, including exchanges.

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:yellow;">**DUE TO PRICE volatility, YOUR TOKEN MAY LOSE ALL VALUE AND BECOME VALUE. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES YOU MADE AS A RESULT OF THE INTERNAL PRICE VOLATILITY OF THE TOKEN.**</mark>
{% endhint %}

CRYPTOGRAPHIC WALLET

The tokens are stored in a cryptographic wallet ("Wallet"). A private key (for example, a passphrase) is usually required to access, control and/or dispose of the tokens stored in your Wallet. Losing access to the private keys associated with your Wallet may result in the permanent loss of your ability to access and dispose of your tokens.

You are solely responsible for implementing all reasonable and appropriate measures to secure access to your private keys and Wallet.

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:yellow;">**WE DO NOT HOLD A COPY OF YOUR PERSONAL KEY. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE DUE TO YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS YOUR WALLET AND/OR PERSONAL KEYS**</mark>
{% endhint %}

####

#### PROTOCOL

Tokens are recorded on a distributed ledger (usually shared across a network of users) which are governed by, subject to, and distinguished by a specific set of rules known as protocols.

#### Damage, damage and/or protocol omission

Any tampering, tampering, and/or abandonment of the protocol (and any consensus mechanism, if applicable) on which the token is based can greatly affect the price of the token as well as your ability to dispose of the token (especially if the protocol relies on substantial participation and a wide network to operate properly). ).

#### Mining attack

Some protocols integrate a consensus-based mechanism for transfer validation (“Consensus Protocol”). The Consensus Protocol, therefore, is vulnerable to attacks at the validation stage, where token transactions are approved by the network. This can affect the accuracy of transactions taking place on the protocol, and your tokens being misused (for example, through what is commonly referred to as a double spend attack).

#### Hacking and security flaws

Tokens may be subject to expropriation and/or theft. Malicious actors (including hackers, groups and organizations) may attempt to disrupt protocols or tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, sybil attacks, smurfing and forgeries.

Furthermore, some protocols are based on open source software and, as a result, are subject to the risk of vulnerabilities being introduced to the protocol (whether intentional or unintentional) at the development stage. Any of these vulnerabilities could be exploited by malicious actors for the purpose of misappropriating your tokens, or affecting the functionality of the protocol and your ability to dispose of your tokens.

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:yellow;">**WE HAVE NO CONTROL OF THE PROTOCOL. THEREFORE, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROTOCOL.**</mark>
{% endhint %}

#### LAWS AND REGULATIONS

The legal and/or regulatory framework surrounding tokens and distributed ledger technology is uncertain, not harmonized, and unsettled in many jurisdictions.

It is difficult to predict what framework will become applicable to tokens in the near future and how the implementation of dedicated legal and/or regulatory frameworks will affect the price of tokens. A newly introduced legal and regulatory framework may interfere with or otherwise limit your ability to hold or dispose of your tokens, which in turn could result in a financial loss on your part.

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:yellow;">**WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS WHICH YOU MAY SUFFER AS A RESULT OF ANY NEWLY INTRODUCED LEGAL AND/OR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK.**</mark>
{% endhint %}

#### TAXATION

The tax characterization of tokens is complex and largely uncertain. The uncertainty in the tax treatment of tokens may expose you to unforeseen future tax consequences associated with purchasing, owning, selling or otherwise using tokens. You should seek tax advice to understand what tax obligations apply to you when purchasing, holding, transferring, and utilising tokens. Failure to comply with your tax obligations could result in severe fines and even jail time.

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:yellow;">**WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OR OTHER FORM OF LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY TAX LIABILITY THAT IS OR WILL BE APPLICABLE TO YOU.**</mark>
{% endhint %}

#### UNANTICIPATED RISKS

In addition to the risks included in this document, there are other risks associated with your purchase, holding, trading, and use of tokens, some of which we cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in this section.

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:yellow;">**THIS RISK STATEMENT IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE AND SHALL NOT BE TAKEN TO ENCOMPASS ALL RISK INVOLVED IN THE PURCHASE, HOLDING, TRADING AND USE OF TOKENS. SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE EULA, WE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS SUFFERED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF UNANTICIPATED RISKS**</mark>
